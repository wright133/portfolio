                            <b>Umoja</b> (Swahili for <i>unity</i>) has traveled far and wide since its debut, becoming our most exhibited generative art project to date. Built with love by <b>Kamau Kamau</b> and <b>Ian Wright</b> (me), Umoja is not just art ‚Äî it's a cultural dialogue in code, abstraction, and human connection. Here's a look at where Umoja has been showcased and the amazing communities that made it possible:

                        <h3>Art Basel Miami (2023)</h3>
                        <p>
                            Umoja premiered at <b>Tezos @ South Beach / Art Basel Miami</b>, one of the world‚Äôs most prominent art events. This moment marked a turning point in our careers ‚Äî not only did our generative art stand shoulder-to-shoulder with global talents, but we were also part of a live minting experience that brought Umoja into collectors‚Äô hands in real-time.

                        <p>
                            Special thanks to <b><a href="https://x.com/ancurated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@ancurated</a></b>, <b><a href="https://x.com/RefractionDAO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@RefractionDAO</a></b>, <b><a href="https://x.com/tezos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@tezos</a></b>, and <b><a href="https://x.com/fx_hash_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@fx_hash_</a></b> ‚Äî your support and encouragement made this possible.

                        <p>
                            We also got to see something beautiful: triptychs and diptychs of Umoja pieces assembled side-by-side, revealing the tesselated design ‚Äî like an interconnected map of humanity. This aesthetic intention, captured beautifully by <b><a href="https://x.com/nygi_xxv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@nygi_xxv</a></b> (Nygilia), was fully realized in Miami.

                        <p>
                            Umoja was displayed during African Union Day celebrations in Brasilia, Brazil, in early 2024. The project resonated strongly with the event‚Äôs message of cultural solidarity, identity, and community.

                            Umoja appeared in a hybrid art and music event ‚Äî a unique collaboration between <b><a href="https://x.com/zero________one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@zero________one</a></b> and <b>Lila</b>. This immersive exhibition explored culture through sound and visuals, and Umoja‚Äôs presence served as a digital thread stitching global experiences together.

                            In 2025, Umoja was invited to show at <b>Rhizome World</b> ‚Äî an annual global event by <b><a href="https://x.com/rhizome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@rhizome</a></b> and <b><a href="https://x.com/ProcessingOrg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@ProcessingOrg</a></b>.
