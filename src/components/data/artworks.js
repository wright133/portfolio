    description: "'Umoja' is a Swahili term meaning 'togetherness' or 'unity'. Inspired by the bustling crowds common in urban areas, towns and marketplaces across Nairobi, Kenya, This project is a celebration of people from different walks of life coming together to form a larger picture; a picture of culture, identity and belonging. By painting abstract figurines onto a canvas one at a time, what seems like misplaced elements in the beginning eventually blossom into a multitude of well-arranged crowds boasting different traits and unique qualities, yet still existing in an unspoken harmony and understanding; Umoja.\n\nCreators' Note: Each piece comes to life through an animation that takes you through an algorithmic journey paired with watercolor-inspired strokes and blotches. We, the creators, wanted to connect with you, the viewer, through this 'live painting' technique to make the creation process feel more personalised as if you were witnessing your piece being created in real time. We hope that you enjoy this series.\n\nA project by Kamau Kamau & Ian Wright\n\nMeticulously crafted with p5js\n\nReleased for Tezos @ South Beach/Art Basel Miami, 2023",
